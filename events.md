The calendar below shows our upcoming events. Feel free to come along although
some events may have restrictions (_eg 18+, members only_) or require RSVP so be
sure to <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">get in touch</a> beforehand.

There is usually at least one person in our clubroom at all times, so also feel
free to swing by for more information and to check out our space.

### Club Meetings
We host most of our documentation on Google, so you can view our meeting agendas
and minutes embedded on this site. Check the [Meetings](./meetings) page.
