# Curtin Robotics Club Homepage
This is the source code for our [homepage](http://curtinrobotics.github.io).


## About this README
This README aims to help any club member interested in or tasked with
maintaining and updating our website. As it is assumed that most of this is
totally new to each new contributor, it tries to document each aspect as
thoroughly as possible. If you find that anything is missing or have something
extra to add, feel free to add it here, and remember - _Google is your friend_.

The [Adding to the site](#adding-to-the-site) section _attempts_ to list all the
necessary information required to setup and contribute to our website. If you
are a **new member** and would like to contribute, start with that section and
it's various resource links, then talk to the committee about contributing.

If the info provided here does not suffice, you can contact anyone from the
[List of contributors](#list-of-contributors) section. Listed there are the
names of current and previous contributors to the website and should be able to
further assist.


## Adding to the site
##### Foreword
The site is deployed using the free GitHub Pages service and is built right from
the contents of this repository. We currently don't have a registered domain, so
we simply use the one GitHub has provided, which is
http://curtinrobotics.github.io.

The website was started as a test to see whether it would be a viable resource
worth the time investment. It aims to be the central hub for the club to share
what we are about, what we do, project pages/showcases, events, meeting minutes
and agendas, etc. *Note:* it is still a work in progress and the possible uses
and content that it will contain are still being worked out.

##### Languages, Frameworks & Tools
If you would like to contribute to this website you should certainly have some
experience with the following tools. It isn't too hard to pick up along the way
\- the entire site was built by learning as we went.

Obviously, we use **git** and GitHub. This is a version control and
collaboration system that allows for multiple people to contribute to a single
application effectively. Check out the links below for more information and some
tutorials.
- [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/) - start here for in-depth documentation
- [Code School's Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) - This is
    a free course you can do in your browser to learn `git`.
- [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) - The command-line is by far the
    most powerful way to use `git`, but new users may be overwhelmed, if so, try
    this desktop app instead.

Building a website always involves some knowledge of **HTML**, **JavaScript**,
and **CSS**. In broad terms, these control the content, behaviour and appearance
of a website. Jekyll natively supports **Sass**, an extension to CSS so be sure
to check out their documentation. The following links should help you out:
- [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/) - This site has many free (and
    paid) lessons on all aspects of designing a website.
- [W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/) - Various written tutorials for HTML,
    JavaScript and CSS.
- [Sass homepage](http://sass-lang.com/)

We (and GitHub Pages) use [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate our
website. Jekyll is a framework for converting plain text into static websites.
It is powered by **Ruby** but you won't need to know it to contribute. If you
want to help out you will most likely need OS X or a Linux environment, as
support for Windows is reportedly lacking. Check out these links for more
information and to setup your environment:
- [Jekyll Installation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) - Read the
    documentation to understand how Jekyll operates.
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - Follow these tutorials to setup
    your environment.

We've already said that HTML is important to a website, but with Jekyll, we
have almost no need to touch a single HTML file. Instead we can use
**Markdown**.
Contrary to its name, Markdown is a mark up language in which you write plain
text files and render them into something that is nicer to view. The README you
are currently reading is written in Markdown and rendered nicely on GitHub.
There isn't really much to it, but have a look at these resources:
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) - A very nice text editor similar to sublime-text
- [Markdown Cheatsheet][cheatsheet] - A very good syntax reference

##### Contributing
Once you have read (or if you already knew) the information provided above you
should be ready to start contributing to our website - congrats!

To get started, make sure you have a GitHub account and then talk to (or email)
a committee member about gaining access to the repository and what you would
like to add and/or modify. From there, the committee will consider the best
approach to get you adding your "2 cents" and put you in contact with the main
developer.
